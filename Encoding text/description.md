# Caesar Cipher

A Caesar cipher is **a simple method of encoding messages**. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on.

This code implements the possibility of using two languages - English and Russian. In the original encryption the text should be in uppercase, but here case matters.
There is a possibility to decrypt the text.
